## SRCNN-MXNET 
This repo reproduces a prototype of the classical algorithm for Single Image Super resolution (SISR) with convolutional neural network based on MXNET. 

### Prequesity
- MXNET 0.11.0
- MKL/Numpy/h5py/scipy

### Test Environment
- CPU version of MXNET
- Win 10 64-bit & 8G 

### MISC
- The uploaded checkpoint may not provide high performance since only 1,000 iterations were done.

### Reference
- Dong C, Loy C C, He K, et al. Image super-resolution using deep convolutional networks[J]. IEEE T. PAMI, 2016, 38(2): 295-307.
